# The Small Compiler

This project is in progress...

## Description

First, let's talk about what compilers are and what it actually does. When implementing programming languages, usually there are two major approaches programmers follow. These are compilers and interpreters. What is an interpreter? It takes an input which is your program and produces the output directly. However, the compiler is structured differently. The compiler takes an input which is your program and produces an executable version of your program. This executable can be assembly language, byte-code or it could be any number of different implementation languages. Now, let's look at the structure of a basic compiler.

* 1. Lexical Analysis
* 2. Parsing
* 3. Semantic Analysis
* 4. Optimization
* 5. Code Generation

## Motivation

I was motivated to work on this project because of my interest in compilers and super-lady Grace Hopper. Grace Hopper is the first lady who wrote a first compiler for Cobol programming language. Moreover, I believe that knowing the functionality of compilers makes me a better programmer. As a result, an interest to compilers got me started with this project. At the same time, I'm halfway through my online Standford compiler course and soon, I'll start implementing a more complex compiler using Java as a final project to the course I'm taking. So, keep an eye on that.
